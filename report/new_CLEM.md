## Python Applications

Each feature in CLEM is implemented as a separate Python application, making the system modular and maintainable. These applications are located in the `python-apps` directory and follow a standardized structure:

```
python-apps/
├── face-recognition/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── models/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── requirements.txt
├── emotion-detection/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── models/
│   └── requirements.txt
...
```

### Application Management
Python applications are managed through the `AppManager` class, which handles:
- Application initialization
- Process lifecycle management
- Inter-process communication
- Error handling and recovery
- Resource management

Applications can be started individually from the UI or automatically at startup based on configuration.

## User Interface

CLEM features a modern, intuitive user interface designed for ease of use while providing access to powerful features:

### Dashboard
The Dashboard provides an overview of system status, recent activities, and quick access to frequently used features. It shows:
- System status indicators
- AI model availability
- Camera status
- Recent activity timeline
- Quick action buttons for popular features

### Navigation
The sidebar navigation organizes features into logical categories:
- Dashboard
- Vision (facial and object recognition)
- Gestures (ASL and motion controls)
- Media (downloaders and converters)
- Utilities (system tools)
- Settings (application configuration)

### Feature Viewer
When a feature is activated, the Feature Viewer provides a dedicated interface for that specific functionality:
- Video feed for vision features
- Control panels for feature-specific options
- Status indicators and statistics
- Action buttons (pause, settings, fullscreen)

### Settings Panel
The Settings section allows customization of the application:
- General settings (dark mode, notifications)
- Camera settings (source selection, resolution)
- AI model settings (precision vs. performance)
- Application information and updates

### Notifications
The application includes a toast notification system for:
- Feature activation/deactivation alerts
- Process completion notifications
- Error messages
- System status updates

## Configuration

CLEM uses multiple configuration files to manage its behavior:

### apps.json
Located in the `config` directory, this file defines the available Python applications, their paths, initialization scripts, and launch parameters:

```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "id": "face-reco",
      "name": "Face Recognition",
      "description": "Identifies and recognizes faces in real-time",
      "scriptPath": "python-apps/face-recognition",
      "mainScript": "main.py",
      "initializationScript": "init.py",
      "pythonPath": "env/Scripts/python.exe",
      "launchArgs": ["--mode=live"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Electron Store
User preferences and application state are saved using Electron Store, which persists settings between sessions.

## Development

### Adding New Features
To add a new feature to CLEM:

1. Create a new Python application in the `python-apps` directory
2. Add the application configuration to `config/apps.json`
3. Create UI components in the appropriate section
4. Add any necessary IPC handlers in main.js

### Building from Source
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Package the application
npm run package

# Create installers
npm run make
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Check Python applications
python scripts/check_python_apps.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Not Detected
- Ensure camera permissions are granted to the application
- Check if another application is using the camera
- Verify camera drivers are up-to-date

#### Python Feature Fails to Start
- Check the application logs in `%APPDATA%/CLEM/logs` (Windows) or `~/Library/Logs/CLEM` (macOS)
- Verify Python 3.10 is installed correctly
- Run `scripts/check_python_apps.py` to diagnose Python application issues

#### Performance Issues
- Adjust AI model precision in Settings
- Lower camera resolution for improved performance
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Consider hardware upgrades for optimal experience
